This course reflected all of these flaws.

The final project (50% of the grade) was also wayyy too ambitious for a 6-credit course, especially with barely any additional guidance, even when taking the prof's own proposed baseline project. What doesn't help is the harsh grading: we had components which perfectly mimicked the reference implementation, and still ended up with barely half the points, most of the time.

However, it sometimes still feels like excessive work. You will likely need to spend some money on Google Colab, as model training can take a long time (especially for the project), but probably not more than $30-50 in total. The lecturer and staff are very good. The TAs respond quickly and answer questions in the discussion forum better than in most other classes.', '- This course was a roller coaster of emotions. Basically, a very modern course about the most up-to-date well defined NLP contents. It is extremely interesting because of that but the amount of work is enormous and not worth 8 ECTs - The course was given by prof. Antoine. He explains incredibly well and he’s extremely fluent in English, so there will be no communication issues. The classes are recorded and of very high quality. However, despite only mentioning the ML theoretical course as a background, they seem to assume you have some background knowledge in model frameworks, such as TensorFlow. Then, some of the most theoretical parts of the course only touch the surface and are briefly explained, which further makes it seem like they expected us to know such things (such as LSTMs) in a very detailed way, given what was later asked in the assignments. - There were three assignments (40%) and a project (60%) - The first assignment was EXTREMELY difficult and lengthy, while only being worth 10%. Me and many people pondered dropping the course. There were also many unclear things and, although there were TAs answering very fast on Ed, answers to the unclear things got scattered around and it was very hard to be aware of every single detail that was missing. There were other problems, such qs not having enough compute to do everything required. Many complains were made and prof. Antoine responded and, although it fixed some organizational issues, like allowing for more TAs to answer questions, the part of “it’s too much work” basically got responded with “it will get better”. - Indeed, for Assignment 2, the difficult was drastically reduced but the effort was still there (and didn’t compensate the work for just 10% on assignment 1). - For assignment 3, the difficulty was a bit harder but the duration was a bit reduced and this would be the only assignment I considered fair in terms of work. - For the project, the idea was fantastic: build a chatbot like ChatGPT and we were given a lot of resources to do it, like access to the SCITAD cluster and some reservations where for two weeks the MNLP course would have full access to 80 GPUs. However, sadly, the organization had many problems as well and the work was a lot (e.g. just for the first milestone, we were expected to write an individual paper review, a group report and ask ChatGPT to write two answers for each of 100 questions, and manually rate each answer compared to the other in different aspects, making preference pairs) while some implementation details were never explained nor the purpose of some functions and files - Overall, the organisation of the course had a lot of problems: a lot of things were not clearly explained, at the start there weren’t many TAs to clarify the questions we had been having, etc. at one point there was a post on Ed with >90 likes (~1/3 of the course) of a student complaining about the time and the problems of the first assignment. But, despite the mess, it gradually got better and, of course, given the amount of work required, it was expected that the number of unclear things scaled proportionally. - In any case, despite having criticised the problems a lot, there were a lot of positives and the overall content was very nice, direct, and practical. We were given a lot of resources to learn about and we were given a lot of freedom as well. The assignments were generously graded, I assume because of all the problems. - So, given that, I’d say that, overall, it really depends on your objectives and how free you are during the semester. If you really want to enter the NLP field or learn more about it, this is one of the best courses to do that but it comes at the cost of investing a lot of your time learning extra things and to clarify a lot of unclear goals. I found it very interesting to learn how NLP works and the “behind the scenes” of ChatGPT but it was a very stressful experience at times and I didn’t fully learn stuff because I had many parallel things that didn’t allow me to invest more time. I’d say that all problems would be justified if the course was worth more credits (I’d say 12 ECTs)']","['Go to the lectures, but more important, do the Homework and the project with time.

For the project, it is more open-ended, and you have more freedom regarding model size, etc. I would not choose a big model as it will be challenging to train.

It's in french (now that I think of it, maybe it is officially in EN but if everyone is comfortable it switches to FR, can't remember well), taught by the amazing Samuel Bendahan, and basically you're organizing a small event/business/startup (for real!). It's in groups, sometimes rather small (like 5-6), sometimes the whole class gets around 1-2 projects. IIRC the STIL (rather large innovation forum) was created that way. IC Boost Day was a collaboration between CLIC and that course. You can't get away for free, but in the end you'll really do something, and really learn how to work in a team for something else than a programming course. Things organized in that course frequently just keep existing after, and students volunteers in that (STIL is a great example)\n*sourced from the web""]",[]
