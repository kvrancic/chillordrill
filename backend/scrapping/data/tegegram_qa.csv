COM-401,"Hey, for those who have alr had crypto&sec, what is the best way to follow the course? Are lectures a must ?","I didn't look at the recordings, the slides without the lectures are not really helpful I'd say but there is also a provided document you can read on your own that is complete and offers explaination a slightly different way, which can help.",2024
any,"Is 31 credits in one semester too much?","The ''normal'' is 30, so not But it depend on the classes. 2 semester with the same number of credits often don't have the same workload",2024
any,"Is 31 credits in one semester too much?","I would say it depends, I don't have the exact statistics, but a lot of students prefer to get their 90 course credis over 4 semester instead of 3, and that would do more around 23. I would say it still remains feasible to do 30+ credits, but you will probably have less time to spend on each classes, or doing other things",2024
CS-401,"I'm planning to take ML, ADA or algorithms II, not decided yet","ML + ADA can hit hard but you can organise so that you get ahead on the ADA project, clearing up some space for ML",2024

COM-301,"Is CompSec enough for doing Software security or does it require ISP?","ISP for softsec: ISP is mostly the same as compsec, just a bit more advanced. So it should be fine without it",2024
COM-402,"Is CompSec enough for doing Software security or does it require ISP?","ISP for softsec: ISP is mostly the same as compsec, just a bit more advanced. So it should be fine without it",2024

COM-500,"Is it possible to take COM-500 Statistical signal and data processing through applications without having taken COM-300: Stochastic models in communication or is it too much to catch up on?","Should be okay imo, you can always the SSDP prof can always reexplain the necessary prerequisites (it's usually a small class, so the prof is very open to this sort of demands)",2024
CS-401,"How's the workload for ADA and ML","You'll feel their 16 credits lel. Especially ADA.",2024
CS-433,"How's the workload for ADA and ML","You'll feel their 16 credits lel. ML can be quite chill with a chill second project",2024
COM-301,"Hi what’s the difference between CSP and ISP? They seem quite similar","Essentially the same content as ISP, but allegedly less advanced",2024

COM-501,"How manageable is it to do advanced crypto without taking cryptography and security ?","It might be difficult. Even if sometimes the prof recall what we learned in crypto (I think the first week its mostly that), he still act in the basis that you know all of the systems we used. (It's marked a prerequisite because I think all people take it before, not juste some). But also he assumes you know the way of thinking (like games of proof and stuff) which doesn't come so easy. Its hard to say, because in crypto you really touch a lot of subjects and not all are usefull, but some and juste the way of thinking us usefull. But if you're motivated I guess you could try to catch up but it clearly won't be the easiest",2024
