"I must say that this group is actually very useful. I wanted to take time series cause I was interested. And following all the comments that have been made in here, I didnâ€™t. It obviously saved me from 6 months of trouble lol. Ps: of course itâ€™s great chatting with all you guys, even if thereâ€™s spam :p Long live IC-MA ðŸ˜„"
"Eyyo! at EPFL in IC, when a course is mentioned as 'required' on a coursebook, it only means that, according to the profs, you're supposed to suffer and endure great pain if you have not taken that prerequisite course before attempting theirs, but it is not compulsory Often that requirement should really only be a recommendation (or, sometimes, not even a recommendation...) and afaik for ATOPET as long as you've done some form of reasonable introduction to computer security you should be ok - haven't taken the course tho"
