CS-433,"[""Very popular (especially with other sections). 2 nice little group projects, which train you to write a paper, easy to scrape a good part of the grade on it, but majority on the final exa which is a good old MCQ pts negatives as we like them."",""For machine learning, if you already know something about the subject, you can have a great “credits”/“work to do” ratio. You can still have fun on the second project, where you can choose a lab from the school ('ML for Science ' option https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epfml/ML_course/master/projects/project2/project2_description.pdf). Of the two teachers last year, the one I liked best of the 2 is still there, and there's a “new” teacher in place of the other.""]"
COM-407,"[""Personally, I recommend TCP/IP as the course is easy, the content is nice and so is the teacher (he's pro-student), there are quizzes and labs every 2 weeks and, on the other hand, the labs take a bit of time (but are still easy).""]"
HUM-403,"[""You design an experiment (fall semester), conduct and analyze it (spring semester). The experiment is in one of the lab's directions: lying & deception, color & emotion, and a third dimension where the projects offered concerned HCI. Groups are formed by direction and you come up with the question and the experiment within your group. You get a grade based on the report (individual, but the work is done in groups), in first semester you write the first half: intro (including related work; you'll need to read several papers during the fall semester and you'll need to find these papers yourself), the experiment, the participants, how you are planning to analyze the results; in the second semester, you write the actual analysis of the results and the conclusion. You'll typically need to modify your first part too. Understanding statistics helps a lot with the analysis, though maybe someone else in your group will know it. I found that the supervisors are quite interested in the projects and try to help, but if you ask them something they don't know, they might not respond at all for a while""]"
CS-438,"[""The material is great, the project is honestly interesting, but that's where it stops. It's disorganized (as it has been for years), the assistants are just there to see you cry, and the automatic tests are ultra-precise whereas the specs are not at all. And it's a lot of work - I worked almost as hard as I did for my semester project. On the other hand, there's no exam, just the presentation of your project based on the semester's HWs. Oh yes, nobody got any feedback on the semester's HWs, the grade just appeared at the end.""]"
HUM-471,"[""Seems to be very academic with lots of by heart but if youre interested in the thema it can be quite nice Grading is done on classic exams with a midterm and a final I think Professor explains well but its a lot of material ""]"
COM-501,"[""In crypto they have a fairly special grading system, even if you handle the continuous controls/hws you have to have at least 3 on the exam. The examination is difficult but they reasonably correct so no big worries."", ""Following the lectures is clearly a +, because sometimes the slides alone don't really give you a clear context (personally, I had a hard time understanding some of the slides). If you can follow his lectures, it's not a waste of time I think. I really recommend you to read the lecture notes though, whether you follow the lectures or not, as they help a lot more than the slides for understanding the material. When classes switched to remote last year, I mostly studied with the lecture notes, and I feel like I understood the material with that alone.""]"
EE-554,"[""ASP is interesting but destructured af. There are slides but the teacher follows them a little bit, he writes stuff on the board sometimes but not all the time, the TPs are in mamatlab and the solution is given right after the question (so at first you're motivated but quickly you end up reading the correction for not learning much in the end), and there's a lot of important information said orally I find. The end was five open questions about speech processing in general, you had to pick three and write a paving. After you go into class and you follow a minimum, it's 3 credits that's not hard to get. And if you're interested in the subject (voic recognition, vocal synthesis) go for it, I don't keep a bad memory of it.""]"
CS-451,"[""I took distributed algo (I don't know for how much longer). The teacher is great, with a sense of humor, but not the 'in your face' kind. His jokes are discreet and well spaced out enough to bring lightness to the whole thing without slowing down the pace of the course. I like this guy. Exercise TAs do what they can with the limited time allotted (There were only 2 exercise sessions so I can't say too much). Project TAs... Let's just say that the project is VERY LITTLE guided (not a single comment in the template provided, no steps to follow, no nothing, no indication from the TAs who just stare at you saying 'it's easy, it's what you see in class'). In short: either you already know how to do it and everything's fine, or you know nothing and in that case, have the decency (and the ecological spirit) to turn off the light before you die."", ""The problem of the DA project is not really the code itself but understanding what they want and the algorithms that you need to use"", ""I dropped this course last semester I don't think the project's organization was good and I felt super frustrated""]"
EE-559,"[""You've got 80 poorly formulated and sometimes ambiguous MCQ questions, a large proportion of which are pointed at the expected knowledge, while the course is rather superficial. The course is quite long, so you'll have to do some rote learning on concepts that aren't necessarily covered in depth. In SHS mode. Generally, you perform quite well on the project, but you're picked apart by the exam, as Fleuret points out, but he never questions the format of his exam... in short. At least it's 4 easy credits since the project is short and worth 50%!""]"
CS-442,"[""If it's the course with Pascal Fua, i heard it was ok, the prof is not that great but the content of the course is not hard to pass. And it's good to take a course on Vision once"", ""I might not be entirely objective since this is the only course I have ever failed at EPFL (so far!), but I found the course pretty messy. It's hard to determine what we need to know and Prof. Fua regularly losts himself in his explanations and notations. But I mainly failed because of the exam format, a negative points MCQ with too many in-depth questions about extremely specific aspects of the course. To finish on a positive note, the topics covered are pretty interesting"", ""Well... The course is definitely interesting : the python homework are great fun and you actually feel like you are doing something meaningful, the course deals with multiple topics and helps you get a bird's eye view of the subject. The exam format is however inadequate for the course. You have a horribly long MCQ talking about what I considered details. Would I recommend ? A hesitant yes. ( A bit like Twilight) TL;DR : The course is fun but the exam is kinda random.""]"
CS-523,"[""Very interesting course and a very good complement to ISP (Carmela best teacher) but quite demanding. The difficult part is that we have a project in Golang (no panic, even if you don't know the language, you can catch up). All in all, 7 credits is good for this course."", ""I'll add that even though the projects are difficult (and the TAs for the second ones were not helpful), they are really interesting and relevant. The final exam is not hard, similar format than ISP and computer security so even if you don't do great on the project, you can still pass with the final exam (I think it is 60 or 70% of the grade)""]"
MATH-489,"[""Number theory in Cryptography is all about Algebra and Elliptic curves theorems. There are graded homeworks quite regularly so it is not too complicated to get an OK grade. But if you don't like demonstrations and theorems... run while you still can !""]"
CS-444,"[""Theory was pretty easy imo, mostly an overview of the field, good practices, etc. so not really hard mathematical stuff. Not the most energetic prof but it was ok! Project was a vr game on the oculus quest done in unity by groups of 3, really nice if you're into game dev, but was a pain to share code/test during covid since only 1 member had the vr headset (maybe they will change it this year?) Would rate it 5 credits instead of 4 for the amount of work (had to do a scientific paper review + projet + final oral theoretical exam, originally there were also midterm + hands-on exercises, but removed because covid last year) but I enjoyed it !""]"
CS-440,"[""personally: Best course I've had at EPFL. If you're into cg you'll love it"", ""It really requires a lot of work, the teacher said it himself that the course is way more than 6 credits. However, it is also my favorite course and the content is really great especially if you are into rendering."", ""Also one of the hardest I've followed, but completely practical, so time is all you need. No exam, only the project, which is as said worth way more than 6 credits. I've discovered that I love graphics due to this course, and all the time I had to put into it made me drop another course last year. Totally worth it, 20/20 would do again with subsurface scattering""]"
MATH-318,"[""I took it but had to drop because EPFL wouldn't allow me to have exams alongside an internship. The prof is really good, but the course is really pure math, very formal (more so than Gödel and recursivity, given in fall). AFAIR only one person from CS survived until the end, everyone else was in math (I might be wrong). I can send you lecture notes if you want to take a look""]"
MATH-493,"[""There is really not much biology in it as there statistics. You don’t really need bio to pass it. And the professor is quite cool and chill. Would recommend it."", ""To add on the review. The course is definitely applied stats where examples used are on bio data. However, no biology background is required besides common sense (which apparently many still lack...) especially that for the big report, you get to chose the kind of statistical area you're working on. Workload is very light (a few reports to write, last year was not the best example as the prof was hit pretty hard by COVID so she reduced our workload (and thus her workload)). Biggest perks would be interesting course and content with an interested professor, learning R along the way (in the labs which you may or may not do and may or may not like) and especially no final exam. Some claims it's the cheapest 5-credit course at EPFL and I find it hard to disagree.""]"
CS-460,"[""I really enjoyed the course even if the content is not my favourite subject, so I would advise you to go for it :) There are a theorical part, for which if you are interested and motivated, I would say that it is feasible without background, and a coding part (first milestone alone, 2nd and 3rd by group of 5 if my memory is good), which requires background in scala, so this is the part that would be a bit of work if you don't know the language at all. It depends on you motivation :)"", ""Very diversified course with both practice and interesting theory""]"
CS-422,"[""Maybe someone disagrees, but I didn't find it to be a 7 credit course, more like 4-5. The lecture content touches quite different aspects, some I found really interesting, some just ok. The two projects are a reasonable amount of work, okay level of interesting, I found that the concepts they teach were a bit buried in implementation details (yay casting Any to the expected type everywhere), though the concepts themselves are quite nice.""]"
COM-480,"[""course is a joke. didn't learn a thing, didn't show up to the lectures after like week 4 (as 90% of the people). Week 3 you learn Javascript; and by learning JS I mean, 2 hours of 'this is a for loop; this is an if condition; this is how you declare a variable, a function'. Teacher used to be very cool, but he didn't want to continue for logistic reasons. So he got replaced by another teacher from UNIL. The guy is awesomely sweet and really really wants to do good, but not a good teacher. He just took the slides of the previous teacher, didn't change the slides that said who he was (that was awkward). Grade is a project, you must do an interactive visualization (kinda obligated JS and some libraries). Before deadline we showed our project to the teacher, he said 'yeah that's great, just change that minor thing'. So perfect except that? Nope, 4.5. The video lectures/slides are in the drive, if you want to get an idea."", ""project can be quite fun because you can basically choose your dataset and design your own visualizations for the data. If you're familiar with web dev, it's quite easy to get a good grade"", ""About grading: last year we had milestones and each milestone counted toward a percentage to the final grade (kind of like ADA's project). So it was clear what you had to do for each milestone and you get feedback for each. Plus, you have a TA assigned which you can meet with each week during the project/exercise hours. As for how much you learn, I agree you don't learn a lot. They present you some visualization types and what each means, how you can use them so you don't end up with something messy and unreadable. But you can go in depth as much as you want with some of them for the project (technical and design perspective). Javascript with D3 library is chosen to illustrate this but you do learn concepts you can use in other graphs/figures you may need at some point in the future. I would say it's ok for 4 credits but expect more applied work rather than: here is some theory, some exercises, now let's take an exam.""]"
CS-526,"[""The course is mostly relevant if you know what ML is about and want to get a deeper understanding of its mathematical aspects, e.g. what “learning” means and theoretical aspects of gradient descent, tensors décompositions,... I guess there’s no point in taking this class if you haven’t faced enough ML yet, just because it could be hard to understand why you’re doing it. The course is quite challenging and may require much more than 4 credits of work""]"
PHYS-438,"[""I found the material to be very interesting, the course covers a lot of different imaging techniques from the standpoint of physics but also with biomedical considerations. The professor is very nice and the exam was quite easy. I would say that if you are interested in biomedical imaging techniques it is well worth taking. In the beginning I was scared that there would be a lot of physics that would be difficult to keep up with but actually it was fine, there are some more complex physical concepts involved, but not too many and even if you don't understand those, the exam is still very doable.""]"
CS-412,"[""I took sofsec the last 2 years. First year was hell but prof was new to EPFL. Second year was much better, although even a bit easy as you were only graded on projects (exam was transformed into a project because of covid), however, it's really about low-level security: memory corruption, gadgets and stuff like that, if you expect high level stuff, you will be disappointed (web exploitation, crypto, ...)"", ""i'd say the most useful part for sofsec was the buffer overflow exercise, sofsec is much lower level than isp, it goes into binary exploitation, disassembly, bug finding, etc"", ""SoftSec was very nice if the topic interests you. It has a lot of practice that is already quite advanced imo. We had a small CTF as one of the graded homeworks, it was fun. So yes, would definitely recommend if you're interested in security.""]"
COM-402,"[""ISP is much broader in topics, but goes less into details""]"
CS-450,"[""The course is really interesting. It was quite different than the "classic" algorithm courses I took before in the sense that (a lot of) probability and approximation is involved. For me this complicated the reasoning about algorithms, which was pretty much combinatorics until now. The lecture notes are really good and match what is said in class perfectly. And the exam was horrible"", ""can confirm. the algorithms are super cool, expect to never ever use them again except if you work for google, twitter or facebook""]"
COM-417,"[""Don't get fooled by the title. There are almost no 'applications'. Only probabilities and sadness."", ""I took other classes of the teacher, he is really nice and well organized"", ""if you put enough work in it I would say that it's rather fair. You have graded assignments to pump your grades and last year the midterm counted as a bonus. Overall the course is not that hard to pass in my opinion (same number of credits as Crypto but half the amount of work).""You won't regret it ! I really enjoyed both the material and the teacher which is rare in a course""]"
CS-439,"[""Optml is very mathematical and gives you the foundations of the convergence rates for iterative (often gradient based) optimisation algorithms. You'll do a lot of convergence proofs (and proofs in general). It does not require that much notion in probability but analysis and linear algebra are a strong plus. On the other hand there's a project during which you basically have to try to produce a paper (only the experiment section plus intro and outro) about some subject on optimisation in the ml world but the project only counts for 20% of the grade. Exercises are mainly proofs but there are also "fill in the gaps" notebook. However I did not do the latter since the final exam that counted for 80% of the graded was written and was mainly maths. If you do not have any notion in optimisation the course starts from scratch so it's not a problem. I'd say it's a great course to learn optimisation in ML but the course might be sometimes too theoretical if you only want to apply optimisation since you'll do a lot of proofs of convergence.""]"
MATH-342,"[""... prof said in one of her recorded class, that she has no skill to teach 🤷🏻‍♀️ it was surprising to hear that from her I mean she at least knows herself. You have to learn everything by your effort. Exercices were always ahead of the scheduled lessons so you could lost the track at some point. It s 100% of final exam and no documents are allowed in the exam. if you really don’t know the course materials and get used the formulas by doing exercices it might be really tricky. After the exam I had a feeling that I answered most of the questions, but apparently my syntax wasn’t like the one she expected and even my solution was correct she didn’t gave me point. Also during the consultation session there were only TAs but no exam solution that we can check it so it is totally a gray area what was the correct answer that she was expecting to see. Surprisingly TAs also didn’t have the solutions. I suggest you to take that course if that is your only option. Otherwise it will be challenging🙄""]"
CS-420,"[""I would say that if you have zero knowledge about compilers, it can be quite difficult to follow the course. Not impossible though but still.
I took the course but had prior knowledge so maybe someone that did without can help you better."", ""I had no prior knowledge (except for having heard a couple of terms, which I don't think affected anything) and I was fine. Getting used to the intermediate representation took me some time, if anything.""]"
